# Intro

## What is Lyda?

Lyda is a music service - made for everyone.

We are focused on building a platform that is both good for artists as well as listeners.

We want to make sure that artists can earn money from their work, and listeners can enjoy their music without ads.

If you're curious about what we're currently working on, you can take a look at our [roadmap](https://lyda.app/roadmap).

You can also check out our [FAQ](https://lyda.app/faq).

## What these docs are for

While we encourage developers to write tools to better make use of the platform, we also want to share as much of it as we can without impacting our business.

We don't want to rely on the community to make the platform usable and want to engage in active discourse with you to make sure the platform truly benefits everyone.

## Getting started

We recommend first taking a look at our [Data models](/docs/data-models).
