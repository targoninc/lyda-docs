# API

We don't currently offer third-party application support.

However, you are able to call the Lyda API with our [Bruno Collection](https://github.com/targoninc/lyda-docs/tree/main/bruno-collection).
It is not complete, but feel free to contribute to it and improve it to help others!

We recommend using our [data models](/api/data-models) to interact with Lyda's API.
We also don't offer an SDK (yet, but maybe in the future, who knows).
