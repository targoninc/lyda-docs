# ISRC

An ISRC is a unique identifier for a song recording / track. It is used to identify the specific recording of a song, including the artist, title, and other details.
A composition (like Mozart's Requiem) can have multiple ISRCs, one for each recording of the composition (e.g. performed by different orchestras).
